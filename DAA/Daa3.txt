Problem Statement:_ Write a program to solve a fractional Knapsack problem using a greedy method.

# Fractional Knapsack Problem using Greedy Method

def fractional_knapsack(value, weight, capacity):
    n = len(value)
    
    # Calculate value-to-weight ratio
    ratio = [(value[i] / weight[i], value[i], weight[i]) for i in range(n)]
    
    # Sort items by ratio in descending order
    ratio.sort(reverse=True)
    
    total_value = 0.0  # Total profit
    for r, v, w in ratio:
        if capacity == 0:
            break
        # If the item can be fully added
        if w <= capacity:
            total_value += v
            capacity -= w
        else:
            # Take fraction of the item
            fraction = capacity / w
            total_value += v * fraction
            capacity = 0
    
    return total_value


# Example Input
value = [60, 100, 120]
weight = [10, 20, 30]
capacity = 50

# Function Call
max_value = fractional_knapsack(value, weight, capacity)
print(f"Maximum value that can be obtained = {max_value}")
